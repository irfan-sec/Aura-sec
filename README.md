## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Scanning Capabilities
* **Multi-Protocol Scanning:** TCP, UDP, and combined TCP+UDP scanning modes
* **Multi-threaded Performance:** High-speed scanning using configurable thread pools
* **Multiple Scan Modes:** Normal, Anonymous (Tor), Stealth, and Intelligence scanning
* **Port Range Flexibility:** Scan common ports (1-1024) or specify custom ranges
* **Hostname Resolution:** Accepts both IP addresses and hostnames as targets

### Advanced Service Detection
* **Enhanced Banner Grabbing:** Protocol-specific probes for HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, SMTP, FTP
* **Web Technology Detection:** Identifies web servers, frameworks, and CMS platforms
* **SSL/TLS Analysis:** Certificate information and basic vulnerability assessment
* **Service Fingerprinting:** Recognizes 12+ common services with signature database

### Intelligence Gathering
* **Shodan Integration:** Optional API integration for additional target intelligence
* **Vulnerability Detection:** FTP anonymous login, SSL certificate issues
* **Organizational Intelligence:** ISP, organization, and geographic information

### Stealth & Operational Security
* **Stealth Mode:** Configurable scan delays and reduced thread counts
* **Anonymous Scanning:** Tor network integration for anonymized reconnaissance  
* **Randomized Timing:** Evade basic rate limiting and detection systems

### Professional Reporting
* **Multiple Output Formats:** JSON, CSV, and enhanced text reports
* **Comprehensive Metadata:** Scan statistics, timing, and target information
* **Intelligence Integration:** Shodan data included in all output formats
* **Structured Data:** Machine-readable formats for integration with other tools

## üì¶ Installation

Aura-sec requires Python 3.6+ and several dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irfan-sec/Aura-sec.git
   cd Aura-sec
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) For Shodan integration, obtain an API key from [shodan.io](https://shodan.io)

---

## üéØ Usage

Run the scanner with:
```bash
python3 aurasec.py
```

### Scan Modes

1. **Normal Scan**: Standard TCP scanning with service detection
2. **Anonymous Scan**: Routes traffic through Tor network (requires Tor service)
3. **Stealth Scan**: Slower scanning with configurable delays to evade detection
4. **Intelligence Scan**: Enhanced scanning with Shodan API integration

### Protocol Options

* **TCP Only**: Traditional port scanning (default)
* **UDP Only**: UDP service discovery
* **Combined**: Both TCP and UDP scanning

### Example Session

```
$ python3 aurasec.py
